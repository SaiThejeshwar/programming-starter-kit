# Presentation on Git


<h2 style="text-align: right"> By Shashank Vidiyala </h2>

> ## GIT-:
> 			Git  is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files

>## GITHUB-:
>		GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.


>## Difference between Git and Github
>		Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. So they are not the same thing: Git the tool, GitHub the service for projects that use Git

>### we can manage our source code repository of github by two ways
>1 Using Github Desktop app-: Simple app for basic git Usage <br>
>2 Using shell -:All the functionalities are not available in github desktop like ammend 	filter etc this will be present in shell which is operated by using git commands

>## Some Git shell commands-:
>git add-: Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.<br>
>
>git branch-: This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.
>
>git clone-: Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.
>
>git pull-: Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update.
>
>git push-: Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.
