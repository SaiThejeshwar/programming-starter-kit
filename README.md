# Programming Starter Kit (PSK)

Many of the young engineers are just wandering where to start learning programming with some of the industry best practices. Having spent more than two decades in software, I felt there is something that I should share with young engineers. The result is Edu-Fi. It mainly focus on developing skills of undergrads in the fields of STEM.

Programming Starter Kit (PSK) helps undergrad students to start learning programming. The repo will be frequently updated with new things to learn. 

Enjoy the programming!
